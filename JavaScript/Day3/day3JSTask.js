// Day 3 Javascript Tasks
//Task 1: Â Create an array of your favourite films / TV shows, up to 
//5 items. Use an array method to add 2 more items to your array. 
//Use a loop to cycle through the array and log each item to the console.

//Task 2: Using a loop generate 10 random numbers between 1-100 and 
//log them to the console.

let number = 1

while (number < 11){

//Task 3: Create a loop that counts backwards from 20-0 logging the 
//numbers to console.

//Task 4: Using a loop generate 5 random numbers between 1-50. For each
// number generated, check if the number is divisible by 5 or not. 
//Log whether it is divisible or not to the console.
